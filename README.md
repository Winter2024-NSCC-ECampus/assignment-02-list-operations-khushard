# Linked List Operations

This repo contains a Java implementation of a singly linked list with various opertaions as part of a data structures assignments.

## Features

### Insertion Operations
- Insert at Beginning: Add a new node at the start of the list - O(1)
- Insert at End: Add a new node at the end of the list - O(n)
- Insert in Sorted List: Add a node at the correct position to maintain order - O(n)

### Deletion Operations
- Delete First Node: Remove the head of the list - O(1)
- Delete Last Nose: Remove the tail from the list - O(n)
- Delete at Index: Remove a node at a specific position - O(n)

### Advanced Operations
- FrontBackSplit: Splits the list into two sublists - front and back halves. If the number is odd, the extra element goes in the front list
- Merge Sorted List: Sorts two lists independently and merges them into one sorted list

## Benefits of Using Linked Lists
- Dynamic Size: No need to define the size in advance
- Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Especially in the middle of the list
- Memory Utilization: Allocates memory as needed
